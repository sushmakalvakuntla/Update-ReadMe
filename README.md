# react-wood-duck

The react-wood-duck is a series of individual styles and components, that when combined make beautiful, intuitive designs.
The shared component library gives developers a collection of re-usable React components and SCSS partials for building their products.

## Installation

using npm,

    npm install react-wood-duck --save
 
  
## Usage


   
     
  

## Development (src, lib and the build process)

NOTE: The source code for the component is in src. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in lib for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to dist, which can be included without the need for any build system.

To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run npm start. If you just want to watch changes to src and rebuild lib, run npm run watch (this is useful if you are working with npm link).
