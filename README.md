# react-wood-duck

The react-wood-duck is a shared pattern library hosting re-usable components and styles to be used across all CWS-NS digital services. This library provides a common ‘language’ for CWS-NS designers and developers for front-end assets. It is aimed at improving communication, collaboration, productivity, and reducing coding efforts.

## List of components

*	Alerts
*	Button
*	Cards
*	CheckboxRadioGroup
*	DropDownField
*	DatePicker

*	Table

## Installation

To Install:

	npm install react-wood-duck --save

For specific version:

	npm install react-wood-duck@version
  
## Usage

Now, you can import the components from the library into the application:

	@import {component-name} from 'react-wood-duck'
  
## Development 
#### (src, dist)

The most important files in this library are index.js and package.json. As you know, package.json is a standard Npm configuration file. In the index.js file, we have the main export for the components to be exported. It points to the **dist** folder which will be created after the publish task has been run. It will basically transpile the code in **src** to ES5 and place all transpiled code in the dist folder.

You will work mostly in the **src** folder where you can write your React component code. If you look in the repo, you’ll find some basic re-usable react components, styles folder where all the CSS and images are located that supports styles. Also in the **src** folder we have the __tests__ folder were you can right your test cases for the components.

**NOTE**: The library is using a babel plugin "transform-es2015-modules-umd" to transpile the code into ES5.

## Contributing

Contribution and Integration of this pattern library by digital services results in reducing coding efforts for all developers. You can contribute by adding new components and by modifying existing components and styles.

### Add and Modify the Components

Clone the repository from git:

	git clone https://github.com/ca-cwds/react-wood-duck.git

To get all npm dependencies in react-wood-duck, run command:

	npm install 
	
For Specific dependency: 

	npm install "dependency-name" 

Create or Modify the react components by following the [Style Guidelines](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react).

Every time when you create the new react components, make sure to export them in the index.js file.
For Example:

	var Alert = require('./dist/Alert.js').default;
	var Button = require('./dist/Button.js').default;
	module.exports = {
		Alert,
		Button,
	};
		
After creating or modifying the react components in **react-wood-duck/src**,
run command:

	npm run prepublish
	
**NOTE:** when you run this, it compiles the **"src"** code and generates the transpiled CommonJS in **“dist”** folder within your local machine 
        
### Push to git

Commit the changes and push to GitHub:
        
	git status 
	git add . 
	git commit -m “Your Message and specify the updated version number” 
	git push origin master  
 	
### Versioning

Use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning:

	npm version patch/minor/major
	
### Publish to NPM

	npm publish -m “your message/version number”
	
### Documentation

When you add the new components, update the [List of Components](#list-of-components) in ReadMe file.			
Any necessary documentation can be added.
